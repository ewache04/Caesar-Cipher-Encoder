# Caesar Cipher Encoder

## Author
Jeremiah E. Ochepo

## Description
This Python program encodes a given text file using the Caesar cipher. The user provides the file name and the shift value, and the program outputs the original and encoded messages.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the file name when prompted.
3. Enter the shift value (number of positions to shift the alphabet).
4. The program will display the original and encoded messages.

## Example
```
Please enter the file name: example.txt
Please enter the shift value? 3

Original message: Hello, World!
Encoded message: Khoor, Zruog!

Each alphabet shifted: 3 times to the right
```

## Notes
- The program preserves the case of the characters.
- Only alphabet characters are shifted; non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
